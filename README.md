➢ A game board (a two-dimensional matrix) with dimensions desired by the user must be generated.
➢ A snake with 5 knots (nodes) should be generated and positioned randomly on the board. 
➢ There should be a food on the board. The location is randomly generated. 
➢ There should be a bomb on the board. The location is randomly generated. 
While the game is being played,
➢ The user is asked to make a move at a time (go up, down, left or right). According to this move, the snake's head is moved to a new position. 
Other nodes follow the previous node.
➢ When the snake's head meets the food, the snake eats the food. As a result, a new node is added to the snake's tail, producing a new meal 
whose position on the board is randomly determined. 
➢ If 3 nodes pass over a bomb, the bomb explodes and destroys the overlapping node on the 3rd pass. In this case, the connection between the 
nodes is restored and a new bomb is produced, whose location on the board is randomly determined. 
➢
End of the game,
➢ The game ends when the snake's head is made to hit another joint.
➢ If the number of snake's nodes drops to 3, the game ends.
